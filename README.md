## Interactive Blocks World

![](example.gif)

This project was inspired by one of Prof. Patrick Henry Winston's [interactive demonstrations](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/lecture-videos/lecture-3-reasoning-goal-trees-and-rule-based-expert-systems/) for MIT's  [6.034](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/) course and my desire to build something with Haskell. I also thought it would be fun to make the robot arm a little bit better at finding space for placing a block than Prof. Winston's version.


### Installation

 - [Install stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/) if you have to.
 - Clone the repo and run `stack init && stack build` in the working directory.
 - If the build was successful, `stack run` or `stack exec interactive-blocks-world-exe` should open an interactive console and a gloss window.

### Usage
Running the `help` command in the prompt would get you info on all available commands.
